# Tenant Management Facility
A JavaFX-based facility management system for students, featuring login authentication, facility booking, payment, and rental history tracking with file I/O and OOP principles

# 🏢 Student Facility Management System – JavaFX

This project is a **JavaFX-based facility rental and management system** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows students to log in using their registration credentials and access various features like booking university facilities, tracking application status, and making payments. All records are stored using file I/O for persistent history.
